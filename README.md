AWS Amplify pull request preview currently only supports private github repositoy. This action deploys your AWS Amplify pull request preview for your public repository.

## Getting Started
You can include the action in your workflow as `actions/amplify-preview-actions@0.2`.

### Basic ```workflow.yml``` Example
Deploy a PR preview branch to the Amplify console App page (not the Previews page) after a reviewer is assigned.

Place in a `.yml` file such as this one in your `.github/workflows` folder. [Refer to the documentation on workflow YAML syntax here.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)

```yaml
name: 'Amplify PR Preview'
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [review_requested]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master

    - name: set branchname env
      id: setenvname
      run: |
        # use GITHUB_HEAD_REF that is set to PR source branch
        echo "##[set-output name=setbranchname;]$(echo ${GITHUB_HEAD_REF} | cut -c-10)"

    - name: deploy PR preview
      uses: yinlinchen/amplify-preview-actions@0.2
      with:
        branch_name: ${{ steps.setenvname.outputs.setbranchname }}
        amplify_command: deploy
      env:
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
